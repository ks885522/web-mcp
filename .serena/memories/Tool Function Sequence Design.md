A typical tool sequence involves: 1. `open_page` to get a `page_id`. 2. A series of actions (`type_text`, `click_element`) using the `page_id`. 3. `wait_for_navigation` is used after actions that trigger page loads. 4. Information is gathered using `list_elements` and `read_text`. 5. The session is terminated with `close_page` to release resources. The `page_id` is the essential thread connecting all operations.
