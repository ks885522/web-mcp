The browser MCP toolset should be designed with atomic, stateful operations. Each tool should perform one basic action (e.g., click, type). The `open_page` tool returns a `page_id` which must be passed to all subsequent tools to maintain state and target the correct page. The design must be asynchronous, providing explicit `wait` tools to handle page navigation and dynamic content loading.
