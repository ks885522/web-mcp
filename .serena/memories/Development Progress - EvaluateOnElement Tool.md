Progress Update: The core developer-grade tool, `evaluate_on_element`, is complete. It allows executing an arbitrary JS function string on a target element, providing maximum flexibility to handle complex, dynamic web pages. This single tool consolidates the functionality requested by QA for getting element details, force clicking, and executing scripts. It has been registered and documented.
